                                <p>Warriors have never chosen to submit? Especially as a #leader, stopping has never been an option for us. 2 weeks of study, 48 hours of intensive training, 50 best leaders have gone through "hard" challenges from the organizers, consolidating experience and knowledge to lead our team firmly goes up. Luckily to be one of those leaders, this kind of experience camping have never been excessive for me as well as F-Student. Obviously, my team have faced the challenges, fight as a soldier during the whole camp. Thank you FPT University for those useful activities!</p>
