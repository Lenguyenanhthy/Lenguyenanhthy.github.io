                                <p>On April 23, 2021, at the Penrose lobby of Gamma building, FPT University, Danang, a blood donation activity named "Giọt Hồng" took place. This is a very meaningful activity organized by FPTU Danang in collaboration with the Da Nang Red Cross Society. Humanitarian blood donation activities so far must have been familiar to everyone. However, this is the first time the program has reached out to a large number of students of FPT University in Da Nang, spreading the spirit and good deeds in the student community of F. On that day, I've donated 250ml blood type B+.</p>

                                    <p>FEN Club – The Environmental Club of FPTU in Danang fired the opening shot with a very interesting event called “Green Sunday”. To be more, “Green Sunday” is a weekly event with the participation of all members of the FEN club. Members will be involved in meaningful and practical activities related to "hot" environmental issues. The first "Green Sunday" took place in the excitement of all FEN club members. The event took place at Tan Tra beach, Ngu Hanh Son district, Da Nang city. As a member of FEN Club, I've join the chain of Green Sundays throughout a month.</p>

                                <p>2.5 tons of rice, 1,000 eggs and 50 bottles of oil for poor people. During the Covid 19 pandemic, I had an opportunity to carry out and contribute a small part in the "Quy Gao Thang Binh" - charity chain of Learnright English Center, which took place at Ha Lam Town, Thang Binh District, Quang Nam Province. Thank you to everyone who has joined hands to support Thang Binh Rice Fund for poor people in this difficult time of the country. No matter how little - or how much, everyone has the mentality of "love". Thank you for the support by my respected teacher - Mr. Duc Viet.</p>
