                                    <p>Recently, EduNext was developed by FPT Education as a platform that supports social constructivism methods in teaching and learning. The goal of this project is to solve the problem of automatically evaluating the quality of answers according to each criterion by using the Natural Language Processing Model (NLP Model) and Knowledge Graph. This AI system uses the lecture questions, assessment criteria, and students' final responses as input. Following processing, the output will be an answer's accuracy in relation to each criterion. Overall, this project will save teachers time by assisting them to provide more thorough assessments and objective ratings for each student.</p>
